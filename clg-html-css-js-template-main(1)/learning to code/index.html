        <h2>What is html?</h2>
        
  <Div>

    <p> HTML is the language used to set up web pages. Html consists of elements which are the building blocks of web development, these consist of content and tags.</p>

<p> Html is a language that allows you to add tags and images to plain text to give meaning and structure to the webpage.</p>

<p> This includes hyperlinks which allow you to jump from one piece of content to another using an anchor element and clicking on them. ie. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"target="_blank">Website</a>>Visit W3Schools.com!</a> 
  <p> Elements consist of content and tags, opening tags and closing tags and paragraphs. eg. <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua </p>
    <p> These all make a HTML element.
    Others include headings h2-h6, Anchor tags to link to websites or other content to include links and images.
    </p> 
  <p> Doctype html Is an instruction to a browser and tells where the html begins and ends. Closing html as this is the last tag on the page. </p>
    
    <p> Head tag - gives information to the browser that is not directly displayed. This includes the title, meta data and the author of the page. </p>
       
    <p> Body tag is the main content of the page to include headings, paragraphs, images and hyperlinks.</p>

   <p> We were introduced and downloaded Visual Studio Code to create web pages.   </p>
  
  <ul> 
        <li> HTML stands for: </li>
  <li>Hyper</li> 
   <li>Text </li> 
   <li>Markup </li> 
    <li>Language  </span> </li>
 
  </ul>
<p> 
  Markup Language add tags to plain text to define meaning. HTML controls the structure of the webpage to include content and words.</p>

<h3>  <u> What is CSS? </u>
 
 <p> <em> CSS stands for CASCADING STYLE SHEETS. </em>
 </p>
 
 <p> CSS controls the presentation of the webpage to include the layout, colour of text and background, size of the html elements and fonts.
    
     </p>

<p> Essentially CSS defines the rules for how the HTML will be displayed. CSS is an external spread sheet that sits in the head section of your html. </p>
     <p> <strong> Together these make up the CSS rule:</strong>
  
      <table> 
        <tr> 
          <td> 1. </td>
        <td> Selectors </td>
        <td> Are used to find or select the html elements in order to style them</td>
      </tr>
<tr> 
  <td> 2. </td>
  <td> Properties </td>
  <td> would include the colours, backgrounds, borders, postioning, fonts, margins and tables etc.  </td>
</tr>
<tr> 
  <td> 3. </td>
  <td> Values</td>
  <td> sit along sided css properties width, margin, padding, font-size, border-width, text-shadow etc.</td>
</tr>
      </table>
</p>
<h4> <strong> <em> You can add CSS to HTML in 3 ways </strong></em>
</h4>

<ol>
<li>Inline styles
<li>Internal CSS 
<li>External Spread sheet (is mostly used)
</ol> 

    <p> <em> Pairing CSS with wih HTML makes a web <sub> design</sub>.
